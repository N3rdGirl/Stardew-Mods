## ![Overview Image](https://i.imgur.com/0PPnuQJ.png)
This mod is tailored to a co-op style of play, however, it will work as a single player save too. The map itself is 185x150 and contains a small warp room in order to more easily get around. There are areas for foraging, and mining but they are locked behind tool upgrades. In order to get around the map faster there are also warp spots.
