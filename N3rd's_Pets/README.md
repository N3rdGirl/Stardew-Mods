## ![Overview Image](https://i.imgur.com/0PPnuQJ.png)
This mod is an updated version of my Dog Substitution mod. It's main purpose is to add my pets to the game. (Right now there's only a few of my pets but I plan on adding more.) You will be able to start a new save and choose one of the animals as a pet or you can adopt them later on from Marnie.
