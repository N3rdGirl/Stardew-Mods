# ![Overview](https://i.imgur.com/0PPnuQJ.png)
This is a custom farm map. It is the default farm but expanded slightly, it gives more space to work with and is the first farm map I have made. It is still smaller than most custom farms but is designed to be a step up from the base game farms to make space management easier and less stressful.

# ![How To Install](https://i.imgur.com/RK7MTYt.png)
Before putting this mod in your mods folder, make sure you have the most up-to-date version. This mod will not work if you do not have content patcher present. Depending on how you play, you may need to select the right arrow on the farm selector for the character creation screen.

# ![Compatibility](https://i.imgur.com/b6c2IjM.png)
This mod is compatible with most mods, it will not be compatible with any other custom farm maps as you can only have one farm. 

# ![Reporting Issues](https://i.imgur.com/prY2LJu.png)
In order for me to understand what issues are being caused I will need to have a copy of your [SMAPI log](https://smapi.io/log). If the problem is a placement issue(IE something that looks like it would be walkable not being walkable) a screenshot of the in-game area. I would also recommend testing with only this mod in case a different mod is causing issues. If it is a mod conflict I will try to fix if I can but do note that I am not 100% versed in how mods communicate with each other.
NOTE: WITHOUT A LOG/OTHER EVIDENCE I WILL MARK THE REPORT AS "NOT A BUG"
