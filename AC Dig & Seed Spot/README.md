## ![Overview Image](https://i.imgur.com/0PPnuQJ.png)
Ever wondered why the artifact spots are worms? What about the seed spots being tufts of grass? Yeah...Me too. So I decided to change them up. This mod takes the wormy little spots and makes them into an animal crossing style of dig spot. Content patcher is required and Generic Mod Config Menu is heavily recommended so that you can change the style of the digs pots or turn them off.
## ![How To Install](https://i.imgur.com/RK7MTYt.png)
Drag into your mods folder, make sure you have content patcher to actually make the mod work.
## ![Compatibility](https://i.imgur.com/b6c2IjM.png)
This mod will not work with mods that change the seed and dig spots. Additionally, some recolor mods might make the spots look weird.

Please provide a SMAPI log in any and all bug reports you make.

I did take some help from this mod for the shape of the dig spots and how to use content patcher to patch them in, but the coloring and shading is my own.
If you would like to add translations for this mod, please reach out to me via Nexus, Curseforge or Discord.

Artwork is mainly done by me with inspiration from a few other mods and heavy use of looking at pictures from my animal crossing game. Feel free to edit if you would like.
